# Notes App with React Context API and Local Storage

This project is a simple Notes App built using React. It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. Each note has a title, content, and a category tag.

The app uses the React Context API to manage the state of the notes globally, ensuring that all parts of the app have access to the current notes. To keep your notes safe, even if you refresh the page or close your browser, the app saves them in your browserâ€™s local storage. This means your notes will always be there when you come back.

The home page shows all your notes, and if you want to edit a note, it opens on a separate page. When creating or editing a note, you can choose its category from a list of options. This helps in organizing your notes better.
